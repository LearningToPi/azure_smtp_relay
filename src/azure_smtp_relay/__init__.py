Module Description: This module provides functionality for an Azure SMTP Relay using Azure Communication Services
    using aiosmtpd as the SMTP server.  Messages received by the SMTP server will be queued and sent serially
    to the Azure Communication Service.  For information on setup of the Azure Communication Service, see the
    Azure_Setup.md doc in the docs folder.

    This module was written to allow relaying of messages from a home lab network out through Azure.  Most ISP
    networks block outbound port 25 (due to spam), and now Azure blocks outbound port 25 unless you have a
    specific enterprise agreement.  Since a VM running in Azure can no longer relay messages, this module was
    written to fill the gap and replace the internal postfix relay that can no longer forward alerts.

    NOTE: This is NOT intended to be internet facting.  This is intended to run on an internal network to allow
    relaying of messages through Azure.

    NOTE: To prevent unintended relaying or spam, a specific list of destination email domains is REQUIRED!  In
    addition, a list of permitted networks that should be allowed to relay is REQUIRED!  Networks should be
    listed in CIDR notation ('10.0.0.0/24', '192.168.100.0/24', etc).  Subnets will be verified using "ipcalc".

    The package is also available as a docker container (...)

    log_level (int): The logging level for the logger.
    max_queue (int): Maximum number of messages to queue.
    enable_send_log (bool): Flag to enable message sending logs.
    send_queue_max_age (int): Maximum age (in seconds) for messages in the queue.
    queue_timeout (int): Timeout (in seconds) for the message queue.
    move_from_replyto (bool): Flag to move 'From' to 'ReplyTo' in the processed message.
    message_retry (int): Number of retry attempts for sending a message to Azure.
    message_retry_delay (int): Delay (in seconds) between message retry attempts.
    retain_log_hours (int): Number of hours to retain log entries.
